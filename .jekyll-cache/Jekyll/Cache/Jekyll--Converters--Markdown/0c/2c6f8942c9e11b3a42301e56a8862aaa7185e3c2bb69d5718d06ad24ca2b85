<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The principle and trend of object detection models were reserached. Between the several models, two (RetinaNet and YOLOv5) were selected to be tested. In order to investigate the application of object detection in practice, a preprocessed on-road vehicle dataset was prepared. The dataset provided location and vehicle information of vehicle objects in each image. Accordingly, the object detection models were trained, validated, and tested. The resulting performace of each model was analyzed and presented at the end.</p>

<p>In order to detect multiple objects in one image or video frame, a training dataset had to provide both classification and localization information. Then, a object detection model trained with the dataset could properly detect where and what they were.</p>
