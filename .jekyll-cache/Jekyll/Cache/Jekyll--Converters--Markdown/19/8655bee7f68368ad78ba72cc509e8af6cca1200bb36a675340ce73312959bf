I"<p>Hi! I’m Tae, a Computer Engineering student minoring in Robotics at Northeastern University. My interest lies in the design and development of <strong>autonomous driving systems</strong> for vehicles and mobile robots using the techniques such as <strong>SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)</strong>, <strong>Computer Vision</strong>, and <strong>AI/ML</strong>. Innovation that self-driving cars and intelligent robots will make in the future is what intrigues and drives me to pursue a career in this research and industry area.</p>

<hr />

<p>Autonomous driving technology requires a wide range of understandings about Electronics, Mathematics, Computer/Software Engineering, and Mechanical Engieering.</p>

<p>Sensors -&gt;  (prob. and stats., linear algebra, and geometry)
Programming,</p>

<p>The roadmaps below show what I am referring to. Check my website to find more about my efforts to become a good slam engineer!</p>

<p>My research lies at the intersection of robotics, deep learning, and control theory, with the goal of developing <strong>certifiable learning machines</strong>.
This means creating robots that discover how to do cool behaviors – with guarantees on safety, reliability, and efficiency.
Some specific techniques of interest are: reinforcement learning (RL), reachability analysis, learning cost-to-go functions,  bridging semantic perception and motion planning, and model predictive control (MPC).
A key application area of interest is <strong>navigation in challenging environments</strong>, such as off-road (e.g., forests, deserts) and alongside humans (e.g., on busy sidewalks, in crowded buildings).</p>

<p>Previously, I was a Visiting Faculty Researcher with Google’s <a href="https://research.google/teams/brain/pair/">People + AI Research (PAIR)</a> team, developing novel techniques for explainable and trustworthy AI.
Before that, I was a Research Scientist and Postdoctoral Associate at the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, working on the <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2022-01-13">DARPA RACER</a> program, the <a href="https://www.arl.army.mil/business/collaborative-alliances/current-cras/sara-cra/sara-overview/">ARL SARA</a> program, and advancing the field of certifiable learning.
I received the PhD (2020), SM (2017), and SB (2015) degrees from MIT in Mechanical Engineering.</p>
