I"¾<p>Examined the actual sensors and mathematical techniques for robotic sensing and navigation with a focus on sensors such as cameras, sonars, and laser scanners. These were used in association with techniques and algorithms for dead reckoning and visual inertial odometry in conjunction with GPS and inertial measurement units. Covered Kalman filters and particle filters as applied to the SLAM problem. A large component of the class involved programming in both the ROS and LCM environments with real field robotics sensor data sets. Labs incorporated real field sensors and platforms. Culminated with both an individual design project and a team-based final project of considerable complexity.</p>
