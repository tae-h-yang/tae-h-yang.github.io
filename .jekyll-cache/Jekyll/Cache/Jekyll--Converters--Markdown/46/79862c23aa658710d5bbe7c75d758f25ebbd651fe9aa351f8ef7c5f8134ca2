I"¯<p>Hi! Iâ€™m Tae, a Computer Engineering student minoring in Robotics at Northeastern University. My interest lies in the design and development of <strong>autonomous driving systems</strong> for vehicles and mobile robots using the techniques such as <strong>SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)</strong>, <strong>Computer Vision</strong>, and <strong>AI/ML</strong>. Innovation that self-driving cars and intelligent robots will bring in the future is what intrigues and drives me to pursue a career in this research and industry area.</p>

<hr />

<p>Autonomous driving technology requires a wide range of understandings of Electronics, Mathematics, Computer/Software Engineering, and Mechanical Engieering.</p>

<p>Sensors -&gt;  (prob. and stats., linear algebra, and geometry)
Programming,</p>

<p>The roadmaps below show what I am referring to. Check my website to find more about my efforts to become a good slam engineer!</p>
