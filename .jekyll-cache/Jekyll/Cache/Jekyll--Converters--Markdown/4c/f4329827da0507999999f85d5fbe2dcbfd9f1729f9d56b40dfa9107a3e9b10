I"ü<p><strong>Description</strong>: Covered circuit theory, signal processing, circuit building, and MATLAB programming. Introduced basic device and signal models and circuit laws used in the study of linear circuits. Analyzed resistive and complex impedance networks. Used the ideal operational amplifier model, focusing on differential amplifiers and active filter circuits. Introduced basic concepts of linearity and time-invariance for both continuous and discrete-time systems and concepts associated with analog/digital conversion. Demonstrated discrete-time linear filter design on acquired signals in the MATLAB environment. Used knowledge of circuits, analog signals, digital signals, and biological signals to build a working analog/digital EKG system.</p>
