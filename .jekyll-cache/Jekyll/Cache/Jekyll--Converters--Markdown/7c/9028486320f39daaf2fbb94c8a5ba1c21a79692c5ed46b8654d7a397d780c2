<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This project was a part of the robot drawing project using a differential wheeld robot for iRobot Inter Hackathon. The robot was equipped with drawing materials and its purpose was to draw objects in reference images. The images were provided either directly from users or from the robot’s fisheye camera which required undistortion. Performing Canny Edge Detection, outlines of the objects in the images were detected and trajectories that the robot should follow while drawing or not drawing were computed connecting the outlines based on closest pixel search. If two outline pixels were far from a certain threshold distance, it was considered as non-drawing area. An additional cascade classifier was used as well in order to detect human faces in the input images and produce better outline results.</p>

<p>The images in Fig. 1 were tested to produce drawing trajectories for the user input image and robot’s fisheye camera image respectively. For the fisheye camera image, it had to be undistorted first so that the resulting trajectory didn’t look different than the actual object. Also, only the desired objects (the human face and logo) in the images needed to be converted to the trajectories. More tested images and results can be found in <a href="#appendix-a-more-testing-images-and-results">Appendix A</a>.</p>

<p>The camera image in Fig. 1 had a barrel distortion. This could be simply undistorted using the camera’s intrinsic parameters and distortion coefficients. The parameters and coefficients were provided in advance so camera calibration was not necessary.</p>
