<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Amid disaster response scenarios, the inherent danger and operational challenges often render it impractical for first responders to execute missions effectively. This situation highlights the indispensable role of autonomous robots as viable assets in such contexts. This project aimed to integrate autonomous navigation and object detection onto the open-source robot platform, TurtleBot3. Its objective was to conduct a reconnaissance mission, enabling the robot to map closed and unknown environments while identifying and pinpointing the poses of victims represented by Apriltags.</p>

<p>The robot comprised of components in Fig. 1 and an additional Pi camera was mounted and connected to the SBC to detect Apriltags as shown in Fig. 2 below.</p>

<h1 id="robot-software-setup">Robot Software Setup</h1>
<p>In order to implement the sensors on the robot and create an effective development environment, several setups were required. First, a personal computer needed to have Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic installed for running ROS Master remotely. Dependant ROS packages and TurtleBot3 packages were installed as well. Secondly, the SBC‚Äôs microSD was burned with Raspberry Pi ROS Noetic image. Thirdly, required packages for the OpenCR firmware were installed on the SBC and uploaded to the OpenCR. Lastly, intrinsic camera calibration of the Pi camera was performed using a checkerboard.
