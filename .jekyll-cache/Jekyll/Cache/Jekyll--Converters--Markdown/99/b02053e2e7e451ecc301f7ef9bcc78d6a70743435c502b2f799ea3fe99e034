I"<p>Studied ordinary differential equations, their applications, and techniques for solving them including numerical methods (using  MATLAB), Laplace transforms, and linear algebra. Topics included linear and nonlinear first- and second-order equations and applications included electrical and mechanical systems, forced oscillation, and resonance. Topics from linear algebra, such as matrices, row-reduction, vector spaces, and eigenvalues/eigenvectors, were developed and applied to systems of differential equations.</p>
