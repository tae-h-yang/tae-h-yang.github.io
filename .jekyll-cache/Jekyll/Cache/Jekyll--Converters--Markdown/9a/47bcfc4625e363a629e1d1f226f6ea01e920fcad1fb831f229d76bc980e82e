<p>Various SLAM algorithms such as Hector SLAM, Gmapping, Cartographer, RTAB-Map and ORB-SLAM 3 were explored to create a map of school tunnel. Data of the school tunnel were collected by a LiDAR, Cameras, and IMU. The sensor data were stored as a rosbag format to test the algorithms individually by replaying the rosbag file on ROS. Each algorithm created either occupancy grid map or point cloud map and their performance was analyzed.</p>

<p>The school tunnel at Northeastern University looked like the map above. The red line in the map indicated where the sensor data were collected and the algorithms had to contruct a map.</p>

<p><br />
more accurate odometry data using IMU
more advanced sensor fusion algorithm using all sensor data
better comparison analysis with a ground truth</p>
