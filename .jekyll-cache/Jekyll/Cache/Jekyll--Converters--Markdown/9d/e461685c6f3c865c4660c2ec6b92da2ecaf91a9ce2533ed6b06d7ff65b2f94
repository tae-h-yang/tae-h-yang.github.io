I"é<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Various SLAM algorithms such as Hector SLAM, Gmapping, Cartographer, RTAB-Map and ORB-SLAM 3 were explored to create a map of school tunnel. Data of the school tunnel were collected by a LiDAR, Cameras, and IMU. The sensor data was saved as a rosbag format to test the algorithms individually by replaying the rosbag file on ROS. The resulting maps of the tunnel were created and their performance was analyzed.</p>
