<p>This project was a part of the robot drawing project with a differential wheeld robot for iRobot Inter Hackathon. The robot was equipped with drawing materials and its purpose was to draw from reference images. The images were provided either directly from users or from the robotâ€™s fisheye camera which required undistortion.</p>
