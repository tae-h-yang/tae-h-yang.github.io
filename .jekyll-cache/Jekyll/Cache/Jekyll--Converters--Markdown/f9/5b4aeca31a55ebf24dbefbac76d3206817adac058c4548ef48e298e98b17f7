<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Amid disaster response scenarios, the inherent danger and operational challenges often render it impractical for first responders to execute missions effectively. This situation highlights the indispensable role of autonomous robots as viable assets in such contexts. This project aimed to integrate autonomous navigation and object detection onto the open-source robot platform, TurtleBot3. Its objective was to conduct a reconnaissance mission, enabling the robot to map closed and unknown environments while identifying and pinpointing the poses of victims represented by Apriltags.</p>
