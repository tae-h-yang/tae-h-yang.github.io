**Description**: Presented an overview of modern communication networks. The concept of a layered network architecture was used as a framework for understanding the principal functions and services required to achieve reliable end-to-end communications. Topics included service interfaces and peer-to-peer protocols, a comparison of the OSI (open system interconnection) reference model to the TCP/IP (Internet) and IEEE LAN (local area network) architectures, network-layer and transport-layer issues, and important emerging technologies such as Bluetooth and ZigBee.
