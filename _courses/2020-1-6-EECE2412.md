**Description**: Reviewed basic circuit analysis techniques. Briefly introduced operation of the principal semiconductor devices: diodes, field-effect transistors, and bipolar junction transistors. Covered diode circuits in detail; the coverage of transistor circuits focused mainly on large-signal analysis, DC biasing of amplifiers, and switching behavior. Used PSpice software to simulate circuits and large-signal models and transient simulations to characterize the behavior of transistors in amplifiers and switching circuits. Digital electronics topics included CMOS logic gates, dynamic power dissipation, gate delay, and fan-out. Amplifier circuits were introduced with the evaluation of voltage transfer characteristics and the fundamentals of small-signal analysis.
