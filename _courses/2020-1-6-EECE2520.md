**Description**: Developed the basic theory of continuous and discrete systems, emphasizing linear time-invariant systems. Discussed the representation of signals and systems in both the time and frequency domain. Topics included linearity, time invariance, causality, stability, convolution, system interconnection, and sinusoidal response. Developed the Fourier and Laplace transforms for the discussion of frequency-domain applications. Analyzed sampling and quantization of continuous waveforms (A/D and D/A conversion), leading to the discussion of discrete-time FIR and IIR systems, recursive analysis, and realization. The Z-transform and the discrete-time Fourier transform were developed and applied to the analysis of discrete-time signals and systems.
