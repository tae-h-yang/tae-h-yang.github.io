**Description**: Covered the design and implementation of algorithms to solve engineering problems using a high-level programming language. Reviewed elementary data structures, such as arrays, stacks, queues, and lists, and introduces more advanced structures, such as trees and graphs and the use of recursion. Covered both the algorithms to manipulate these data structures as well as their use in problem solving. Introduced algorithm complexity analysis and its application to developing efficient algorithms. Emphasized the importance of software engineering principles.
