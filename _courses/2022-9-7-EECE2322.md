title: "EECE2322 Fundamentals of Digital Design and Computer Organization"
collection: courses
type: "Northeastern"
# permalink: /courses/eece2322/ 
semester: Fall 2022
location: 
classes: wide
excerpt: "Covered the design and evaluation of control and data structures for digital systems. Used hardware description languages to describe and design both behavioral and register-transfer-level architectures and control units. Topics included number systems, data representation, a review of combinational and sequential digital logic, finite state machines, arithmetic-logic unit (ALU) design, basic computer architecture, the concepts of memory and memory addressing, digital interfacing, timing, and synchronization. Assignments included designing and simulating digital hardware models using SystemVerilog as well as some assembly language (RISC-V) to expose the interface between hardware and software."
