Hi! I'm Tae, a Master's student in Computer Science (AI specialization) at Stanford University and a recent graduate from Northeastern University, where I earned my B.S. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Robotics. I'm passionate about developing and researching intelligent robotic systems, with a particular focus on the perception stack.
