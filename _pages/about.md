# About

I am currently a Computer Engineering student minoring in Robotics at Northeastern University.

I am currently an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University, with a joint appointment in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering and the Khoury College of Computer Sciences.
I direct the [**Autonomy & Intelligence Laboratory**](https://neu-autonomy.github.io/lab_website) at Northeastern University.

My research lies at the intersection of robotics, deep learning, and control theory, with the goal of developing **certifiable learning machines**.
This means creating robots that discover how to do cool behaviors -- with guarantees on safety, reliability, and efficiency.
Some specific techniques of interest are: reinforcement learning (RL), reachability analysis, learning cost-to-go functions,  bridging semantic perception and motion planning, and model predictive control (MPC).
A key application area of interest is **navigation in challenging environments**, such as off-road (e.g., forests, deserts) and alongside humans (e.g., on busy sidewalks, in crowded buildings).

Previously, I was a Visiting Faculty Researcher with Google's [People + AI Research (PAIR)](https://research.google/teams/brain/pair/) team, developing novel techniques for explainable and trustworthy AI.
Before that, I was a Research Scientist and Postdoctoral Associate at the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, working on the [DARPA RACER](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2022-01-13) program, the [ARL SARA](https://www.arl.army.mil/business/collaborative-alliances/current-cras/sara-cra/sara-overview/) program, and advancing the field of certifiable learning.
I received the PhD (2020), SM (2017), and SB (2015) degrees from MIT in Mechanical Engineering.
