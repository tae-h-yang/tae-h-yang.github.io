Hi! I'm Tae, a Computer Engineering student minoring in Robotics at Northeastern University. My interest lies in the design and development of **autonomous driving systems** for vehicles and mobile robots using the techniques such as **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**, **Computer Vision**, and **AI/ML**. Innovation that self-driving cars and intelligent robots will bring in the future is what intrigues and drives me to pursue a career in this research and industry area.

Autonomous driving technology requires a wide range of understandings about Electronics, Mathematics, Computer/Software Engineering, and Mechanical Engieering.  

Sensors ->  (prob. and stats., linear algebra, and geometry)
Programming,  

The roadmaps below show what I am referring to. Check my website to find more about my efforts to become a good slam engineer!
