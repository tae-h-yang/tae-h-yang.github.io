    <p class="archive__item-excerpt hidden" itemprop="description" style="font-size: 1em;">Introduces topics such as image formation, segmentation, feature extraction, matching, shape recovery, dynamic scene analysis, and object recognition. Computer vision brings together imaging devices, computers, and sophisticated algorithms to solve problems in industrial inspection, autonomous navigation, human-computer interfaces, medicine, image retrieval from databases, realistic computer graphics rendering, document analysis, and remote sensing. The goal of computer vision is to make useful decisions about real physical objects and scenes based on sensed images. Computer vision is an exciting but disorganized field that builds on very diverse disciplines such as image processing, statistics, pattern recognition, control theory, system identification, physics, geometry, computer graphics, and learning theory. Requires good programming experience in Matlab or C++.</p>

These were used in association with techniques and algorithms for dead reckoning and visual inertial odometry in conjunction with GPS and inertial measurement units. Covered Kalman filters and particle filters as applied to the SLAM problem. A large component of the class involved programming in both the ROS and LCM environments with real field robotics sensor data sets. Labs incorporated real field sensors and platforms. Culminated with both an individual design project and a team-based final project of considerable complexity.</p>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt hidden" itemprop="description" style="font-size: 1em;">Developed the basic theory of continuous and discrete systems, emphasizing linear time-invariant systems. Discussed the representation of signals and systems in both the time and frequency domain. Topics included linearity, time invariance, causality, stability, convolution, system interconnection, and sinusoidal response. Developed the Fourier and Laplace transforms for the discussion of frequency-domain applications. Analyzed sampling and quantization of continuous waveforms (A/D and D/A conversion), leading to the discussion of discrete-time FIR and IIR systems, recursive analysis, and realization. The Z-transform and the discrete-time Fourier transform were developed and applied to the analysis of discrete-time signals and systems.</p>

      <!-- <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>Developed the basic theory of continuous and discrete systems, emphasizing linear time-invariant systems. Discussed the representation of signals and systems in both the time and frequency domain. Topics included linearity, time invariance, causality, stability, convolution, system interconnection, and sinusoidal response. Developed the Fourier and Laplace transforms for the discussion of frequency-domain applications.

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt hidden" itemprop="description" style="font-size: 1em;">Reviewed basic circuit analysis techniques. Briefly introduced operation of the principal semiconductor devices: diodes, field-effect transistors, and bipolar junction transistors. Covered diode circuits in detail; the coverage of transistor circuits focused mainly on large-signal analysis, DC biasing of amplifiers, and switching behavior. Used PSpice software to simulate circuits and large-signal models and transient simulations to characterize the behavior of transistors in amplifiers and switching circuits. Digital electronics topics included CMOS logic gates, dynamic power dissipation, gate delay, and fan-out. Amplifier circuits were introduced with the evaluation of voltage transfer characteristics and the fundamentals of small-signal analysis.</p>
